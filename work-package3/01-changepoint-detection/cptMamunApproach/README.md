## Get Changepoint from Surge Reconstruction STD time series

### 1. Shuffle reconstruction STD time series 1000 times

### 2. Compute BCP for each of the 1000 time series for 882 tide gauges

### 3. Concatenate the 1000 BCP simulations 

### 4. Get the probability rrange {min, max}

### 5. Compute the hit rate - when original BCP probability exceeds the max from (4)

### 6. Include lon/lat data for plotting purposes

### 7. Get the most recent CPT of all available tide gauges - also georeferenced

### 8. Plot the global changepoints

### 9. Merge 20-CR and ERA-20C changepoint analysis

### 10. Plot surge reconstruction time series [obs/20-CR/ERA-20C]

### 11. Plot histograms to compare changepoints

### 12. Organize reconstructions as per changepoitn analysis [era20c]

### 13. Organize reconstructions as per changepoitn analysis [20-cr]
